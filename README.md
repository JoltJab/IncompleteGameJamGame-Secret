# Incomplete Game Jam Game. Theme "Secret"

The Godot 4.3 files

To learn a little about what I'm currently capable of, I joined into the game jam "Game Off 2024" (link here: https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2024) on Itch.io. I tried making my first 3D game. It uh..... went about as well as a first project would go. Still, for the sake of documenting my progress, and to share what I learned, I will still put it up here. Honestly it isn't super fun to play, but it does have some minorly interesting systems, if not a little cobbled together.  
  
I learned a few new things (one being I still got a long way to go) so I'm still happy with how things went. If you're reading this, thanks for taking an interest in the stuff I make, even if in this case it isn't my best work.  
  
You can mess around with the project on Itch.io here: https://joltjab.itch.io/game-jam-game-theme-secret
